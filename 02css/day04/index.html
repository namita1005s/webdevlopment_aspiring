        Data science is an essential part of many industries today, given the massive amounts of data that are produced, and is one of the most debated topics in IT circles. Its popularity has grown over the years, and companies have started implementing data science techniques to grow their business and increase customer satisfaction. In this article, we’ll learn what data science is, and how you can become a data scientist.</p>
    <h2>What Is Data Science?</h2>
    <p>Data science is the domain of study that deals with vast volumes of data using modern tools and techniques, including essential data science skills, to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information, and make business decisions. Data science uses complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. The data used for analysis can come from many different sources and presented in various formats. Now that you know what data science is, let’s see the data science lifestyle.</p>
    <h2>Data Science Lifecycle</h2>
    <p>Now that you know what is data science, next up let us focus on the data science lifecycle. Data science’s lifecycle consists of five distinct stages, each with its own tasks:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Capture: Data Acquisition, Data Entry, Signal Reception, Data Extraction. This stage involves gathering raw structured and unstructured data.</li>
        <li>Maintain: Data Storage, Data Processing, Data Security, Data Handling. This stage involves storing and processing the data.</li>
        <li>Process: Data Mining, Data Clustering, Data Cleaning, Data Transformation. This stage involves cleaning and transforming the data.</li>
        <li>Analyze: Data Modeling, Data Summarization, Data Validation, Data Visualization. This stage involves analyzing the data.</li>
        <li>Communicate: Data Reporting, Data Visualization, Business Intelligence, Decision Making. This stage involves communicating the data.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Applications of Data Science</h2>
    <p>Data science is used in various industries, including healthcare, banking, e-commerce, and many more. Here are some of the applications of data science:</p>
