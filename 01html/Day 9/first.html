        <h1>Introduction to C++</h1>
        <br>
        <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs. It is an extension of the C programming language and includes features such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and data abstraction. C++ is widely used for developing system software, application software, device drivers, embedded software, and games.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Features of C++</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Object-Oriented Programming: C++ supports object-oriented programming paradigms such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.</li>
            <li>Platform-Independent: C++ programs can be compiled and executed on different platforms without any modifications.</li>
            <li>High-Level Language: C++ is a high-level language that provides abstractions for complex data structures and operations.</li>
            <li>Efficient: C++ allows low-level programming and provides direct access to system resources, making it efficient for system programming.</li>
            <li>Rich Library Support: C++ provides a rich set of libraries for various data structures, algorithms, and input/output operations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Basic Syntax</h2>
        <pre style="background-color: aquamarine;">
            <code><!--<> = &lt and &gt-->
                #include &lt;iostream&gt;
                using namespace std;

                int main() {
                    cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!" &lt;&lt; endl;
                    return 0;
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <ul>
            <li>#include &lt;iostream&gt;: This line includes the iostream header file, which contains the input/output stream classes.</li>
            <li>using namespace std;: This line declares that the code is using the std namespace, which contains the standard C++ library.</li>
            <li>int main(): This line declares the main function, which is the entry point of a C++ program.</li>
            <li>cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!" &lt;&lt; endl;: This line prints the message "Hello, World!" to the standard output stream.</li>
            <li>return 0;: This line returns 0 to the operating system, indicating that the program executed successfully.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Applications of C++</h2>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>System Software: C++ is used to develop system software such as operating systems, device drivers, and compilers.</li>

         <h2>Introduction to Arrays</h2>
         <br>
         <h3>What is an Array</h3>
         <br>
            <p>An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).</p>
            <br>
            <img src="./Array-data-structure.png" alt="Array picture">
        <h3> Characteristics of Arrays</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Arrays store elements of the same type.</li>
            <li>Arrays have a fixed size that needs to be specified at the time of array declaration.</li>
            <li>Arrays have contiguous memory locations.</li>
            <li>Array elements can be randomly accessed by using the index number.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Types of Arrays </h3>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>One-dimensional Arrays: A linear list of elements , where each elements can be accessed by a single index.</li>
            <ul type="circle">
                <li> Example: int numbers[5]:(stores 5 integers)</li>

            </ul>
            <li>Multi-dimensional Arrays: An array of arrays, where each element is accessed by multiple indices.</li>
            <ul type="circle">
                <li>Example: int numbers[2][3]:(stores 2 arrays of 3 integers each)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Dynamic Arrays: Arrays that can grow or shrink in size.</li>

         <br>
            <h2>What is a Tree?</h2>
            <p>A tree is a non-linear data structure that is used to store data in a hierarchical manner. It is a collection of nodes connected by edges. Each node contains a value or data, and it may or may not have child nodes. The topmost node in a tree is called the root node, and the nodes that do not have any child nodes are called leaf nodes.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>What is a Graph?</h2>
        <p>A graph is a non-linear data structure that is used to represent relationships between objects. It consists of a set of vertices (nodes) and a set of edges that connect the vertices. The edges may be directed or undirected, and they may have weights associated with them. Graphs are used to model a wide variety of real-world problems, such as social networks, transportation networks, and computer networks.</p>
